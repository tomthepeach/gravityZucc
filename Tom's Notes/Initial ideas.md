### Objective 

To produce a highly optimised realitme 'n-body' (doesn't have to be 100% physical) to run on a vr headset. End product needs to involve some level of n-body simulation and significant visual appeal


##### Performance:
- Dynamically scale number of particles using collision and distortion to combine and split physical bodies.
- All bodies are an eliptical with simple properties: 
Orientation
Radius
(xyz) eccentricity
Temperature

- Need to code in data collection



##### Realism:

- Bodies glow when they get hot
- Bodies produce dust when they collide, dust will be visual.
- Dust (not physically simultated) gets 'reabsorbed'
- Collisions deform bodies, eccentricity is modified depending on physical parameters of collision colder - harder to deform, hotter more 'liquid like'
-
