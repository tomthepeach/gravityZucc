##### Latency (input - response)
- We believe the threshold for compelling VR to be at or below 20ms of latency. Above this range, users reported feeling less immersed and comfortable in the environment. When latency exceeds 60ms, the disjunction between oneâ€™s head motions and the motions of the virtual world start to feel out of sync, causing discomfort and disorientation. Large latencies are believed to be one of the primary causes of discomfort. Independent of comfort issues, latency can be disruptive to user interactions and presence. In an ideal world the closer you are to 0ms the better. If latency is unavoidable, it will be more uncomfortable the more variable it is. Your goal should be the lowest and least variable latency possible.
