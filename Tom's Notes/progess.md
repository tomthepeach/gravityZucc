### Setting up development environment

To get the Quest 2 set up for development with unreal engine I need several things:

- Unreal engine
- Android studio/sdks
- Occulus PC app

I use a linux desktop, which has the hardware needed to run unreal engine.
Unfortunately by the grace of Zucc, the occulus PC app is only distrubuted for mac and windows :)

After many hours of trying to get things to work/hacky attempts to find a workaround I have given into Bill Gates and partioned a hard drive to dual boot Windows so I can start making progress.
