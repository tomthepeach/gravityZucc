### Setting up development environment

To get the Quest 2 set up for development with unreal engine I need several things:

- Unreal engine
- Android studio/sdks
- Occulus PC app

I use a linux desktop, which has the hardware needed to run unreal engine.
Unfortunately by the grace of Zucc, the occulus PC app is only distrubuted for mac and windows :)

After many hours of trying to get things to work/hacky attempts to find a workaround I have given into Bill Gates and partioned a hard drive to dual boot Windows so I can start making progress. 

Successfull dual booted windows 10

### Setting up dev environment on windows

I have installed the following:

- Unreal engine
- Android studio
- Occulus PC app
- Java SDK
- Android SDK

After several hours of tinkering and troubleshooting, I have managed to package the deafult vr demo in unreal engine and upload it to the Quest headset!
