TODO:
- Get the galaxy rotating appropriately
- Sort out the units so that distances and masses are realistic
- Figure out how to change star colour
- Figre out how to render blackhole 
- make blackholes a special object - doesn't turn into a star, perhaps the type of the more massive object is preserved
- Add some kind of interaction? Spawn another blackhole, trigger scales mass?
- Add real time data display for KE and PE if selected? https://bjmercier.medium.com/graphing-time-series-data-through-unity-463a35821f77
-- Add changable parameters to the satrt menu


ALMOST DONE:
