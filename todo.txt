- Get the galaxy rotating appropriately
- Sort out the units so that distances and masses are realistic
- Scale the star combination to be less glitchy
- make blackholes a special object - doesn't turn into a star, perhaps the type of the more massive object is preserved
- Add start menu
- Add some kind of interaction? Spawn another blackhole, trigger scales mass?
